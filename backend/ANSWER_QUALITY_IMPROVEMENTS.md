# Answer Quality Improvements

## Problem

The RAG system was giving awkward answers that:
- Mentioned "code snippets" and "provided files" 
- Showed raw code with line numbers and markers
- Didn't sound natural or conversational
- Failed to give clear, direct answers

### Example of Poor Answer:
```
The provided code snippets do not explicitly mention a "ranking" method...
The files listed include a `ChunkerService` for text chunking...

Sources:
(lines -)
"""
Content chunking and text processing module
"""
import re
...
```

## Solution

Updated three key areas to improve answer quality:

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts (`backend/src/config.py`)

**Before:**
```python
"system_prompt": "You are an expert code analysis assistant..."
```

**After:**
```python
"system_prompt": """You are an expert code analysis assistant helping developers understand their codebase.

Guidelines:
1. Provide clear, conversational answers - avoid mentioning "code snippets" or "provided files"  
2. Answer questions based on what you observe in the repository
3. Be specific about file names, functions, and implementations when relevant
4. If something isn't found, say so clearly rather than being vague
5. Focus on answering the actual question directly and concisely
6. Reference the repository/codebase naturally (e.g., "In this repository..." or "The codebase uses...")

Answer style: Professional but conversational, as if explaining to a colleague."""
```

### 2. Better Context Formatting (`backend/src/services/rag_service.py`)

**Before:**
```python
code_context += f"\nFile: {src.file} (score: {src.score})\n"
code_context += f"```\n{src.content}\n```\n"
```

**After:**
```python
code_context += f"\nFrom {src.file}:\n{src.content}\n"
```

No more:
- Score indicators in prompts
- Triple backticks around code
- Meta-information that confuses the model

### 3. Simplified Instructions

**Before:**
```python
instructions = """IMPORTANT: When answering technical questions:
1. Be precise with specific values, names, and parameters
2. Quote exact code snippets when available
3. Distinguish between different files and their purposes
4. If you're unsure about specific values, say so rather than guessing
5. Focus on the most relevant information from the source files"""
```

**After:**
```python
instructions = """When answering:
- Speak naturally about the repository, not "provided code snippets"
- Reference files and functions specifically when relevant
- Give direct, clear answers
- If information is not available, say so clearly"""
```

### 4. Better Prompt Endings

**Before:**
```
Based on the provided source code, please provide a detailed and accurate answer...
Answer:
```

**After:**
```
Answer naturally and conversationally about what you observe in the repository.
```

## Expected Improvement

### Question: "What method is used for ranking?"

**Before (Poor Answer):**
```
The provided code snippets do not explicitly mention a "ranking" method within the given context. 
The files listed include a `ChunkerService` for text chunking, a `Config` class for configuration 
management, and an `IndexerService` for indexing content into a vector store...

Sources:
(lines -)
"""Content chunking and text processing module"""
import re
...
```

**After (Better Answer - Expected):**
```
In this repository, ranking is likely handled by the vector store component within the IndexerService. 
The system uses similarity scoring to rank retrieved content, typically through cosine similarity 
between query embeddings and document embeddings. The ChunkerService prepares the content, and the 
IndexerService manages the vector operations that enable ranking search results by relevance.
```

## Testing

Run the test to see improvements:

```powershell
cd backend
python test_improved_answers.py
```

This will:
1. Load the model
2. Ask the same ranking question
3. Show the improved answer
4. Check for quality improvements

## Quality Checks

The test verifies:
- ✓ No mentions of "code snippets" or "provided files"
- ✓ Natural references to "repository" or "codebase"
- ✓ Detailed, helpful answers
- ✓ Direct responses to questions

## Benefits

1. **More Natural**: Answers sound like explanations from a colleague
2. **More Accurate**: Focuses on actual content rather than meta-information
3. **More Helpful**: Gives direct answers instead of describing what files exist
4. **Better UX**: Users get real information, not descriptions of code structure

## Next Steps

If answers are still not satisfactory:

1. **Improve Retrieval**: Better keyword matching or implement semantic search
2. **Add More Context**: Include more relevant files in retrieval
3. **Fine-tune Temperature**: Adjust `temperature` in config (lower = more focused)
4. **Increase Max Tokens**: Give model more space to elaborate

## Configuration

Current settings in `config.py`:
```python
"temperature": 0.7,  # Lower for more focused answers
"max_tokens": 512,   # Increase for longer answers
"context_length": 8192  # How much context the model can see
```

Adjust these based on your needs!
